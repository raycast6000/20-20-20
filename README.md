# 20-20-20
Most of the time I'm busy so I wrote this program that every 20 minutes reminds me to look at something at least 20-feet away.

# Installation
Run this command:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/raycast6000/20-20-20.git
```
Or build it:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
In order to make this program run at startup you must make a shortcut for it and move the shortcut to this folder: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
